## Overview
This project was supposed to be a basic demostration of the main OOP concepts - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
_(actually in my time I was taught that there were only former 3, but apparently it gets popular to include Abstraction as fourth pillar)_

As I was thinking about the project my initial idea was to just make few items that inherit from common base class.
But to get things more interesting and learn more about the editor I've decided to implement this project in a form of fantasy shop in the middle of forest.

I've added full scene with multi-layered background, used tilemaps for ground, tryed to simulate far objects in the shop with color tints and so on. 
I wanted to try myself at creating environment. I was pretty happy with how the scene looked, but that was not the end.
After that I've added a UI to show player stats that would react to items bought in shop.
Later on I've also added some basic VFX and SFX for mouse clicks and item interactions.

It took me a while to figure out how to implement most of that, but I've learned a lot in the process! And also I really like the final look :)
